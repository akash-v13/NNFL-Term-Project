# NNFL-Term-Project
The following repository contains all the related files/results that were used/obtained from the term project that was given to my team during the 1st semester of the academic year of 2020-21.  

The objective of the project was to read through the paper "[Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf)" and implement the results of the paper as per the following details:  

        1.Train the model on the Van Gogh style transfer dataset 
        2.Plot a graph of training accuracies across epochs
        3.Calculate the FCN evaluation metric to evaluate the model
        4.Apply the model to images of another painting dataset such as Monet or Cezanne and show results
        5.Calculate the per-pixel and per-class accuracy for the above

The contents of the repository are:  
        1.NNFL_Paper13.ppt --- contain the powerpoint presentation for this term paper   
        2. NNFL_Assignment_CycleGAN.ipynb - contains the code that is used to create, train and test or implementation of CycleGAN. All details about the explaination of functions and files, and instructions to execute the code is present within the tex cells of the notebook.  
        3. Base Code - contains original base code for the implementation of CycleGAN (contents of each file and function are given at the start of the notebook).    
        4. loss_log.txt   - contaians the numeric values of all the different losses throughout the training process of 200 epochs.       
        5. train_opt.txt  - contains the details of the configurations we used to train the model.     
       
      
Note: The notebook itself is sufficient to train the model
