# NNFL-Term-Project
The following repository contains all the related files/results that were used/obtained from the term project that was given to my team during the 1st semester of the academic year of 2020-21.  

The objective of the project was to read through the paper "[Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf)" and implement the results of the paper as per the following details:  

        1.Train the model on the Van Gogh style transfer dataset 
        2.Plot a graph of training accuracies across epochs
        3.Calculate the FCN evaluation metric to evaluate the model
        4.Apply the model to images of another painting dataset such as Monet or Cezanne and show results
        5.Calculate the per-pixel and per-class accuracy for the above
